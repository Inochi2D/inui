# InUI
This library provides a shared UI base for Inochi2D applications in the 0.8 series,
this will mostly be superseded by [libsoba](https://github.com/Inochi2D/libsoba) in the future,
but may still see updates for smaller utilities.

The codebase is currently undergoing heavy retooling to unify things such as high-dpi support,
theming support, settings store, widgets and the like. You can give it a shot but expect things
to break from time to time for the time being.

## Dependencies

InUI depends on a few libraries to function correctly, the libraries are as follows:
